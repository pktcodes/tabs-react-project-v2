#### Tabs consists of a straightforward user interface where there is a

- List of buttons with a **Company Name** which on click shows the job info experience in that particular company.
- Each single experience card has **title**, **dates**, **company**, **duties**.
- **`Loading`** spinner has been implemented which will be shown while fetching data, once the data is available the main page will be shown. 
- Data is handled by the external `API` and styles are handled in `index.css`.
- To run the project locally, clone the repo, `npm install` to install the dependencies, and `npm run dev` to start up the development server on default port 5173.
